# Autotest with Golang

Running your tests automatically is good. There are a bunch of tools out there
to do this. Some are language or framework specific. Some are cumbersome.

The best autotest runner and file watcher tool is [entr(1)](http://entrproject.org).

ENTR, or the Event Notify Test Runner, is a very simple UNIX utility.

It can be easily installed with your favorite package manager:

On Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install entr

On OSX with Homebrew:

    $ brew install entr

The homepage has great [documentation](http://entrproject.org) so I won't repeat too much. I do want to share a simple Golang script I use.

Just name it something like `autotest.sh`, make it executable and watch your tests run every time you change or add a Go file:

    #!/bin/bash

    which entr > /dev/null
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        # your package manager here
        echo "installing entr with homebrew"
        brew install entr 
    else
      echo "go autotest started"
    fi

    while sleep 1; do
      # add your own test command and flags
      ls *.go | entr -d -c go test ./... -logtostderr=true
    done

It's so much nicer to run the tests automatically, and since Go tests are blazing fast, there's no reason not to.
